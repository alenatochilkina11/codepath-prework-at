#  App Brainstorming

 ## Reddit
 - Customizing the avatar
 - Custom "Home" screen -- out of "Latest", "Watch", "News", and "Popular" categories, I could choose which ones to exclude, anfd in which order they appear
 
 ## TikTok
 - Jumping to "Recently Viewed" video when creator's account is clicked
 - Double click to "like"
 
 ## Telegram
 - Almost momentarily sysncs with all logged in devices
 - Can host thousand of people in chat groups
 - Great sticker options
 - Comfortable location sharing -- share live location for 15mins, 1hr, or 8hrs
 
 ## Slack
 - Awesome device syncing -- I attached the picture to a message on the phone and that same file appeared on my laptop before the message was sent
 - The concent of channels and direct messages are kept visually separate (as oppose to telegram)
