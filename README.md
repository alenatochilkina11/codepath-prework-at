**HueHello** is an app that introduces me to CodePath staff. The app changes backround color on a tap of the button;

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total (1.5 hours on creating a GIF)

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## Additional Features

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
 ### Reddit
 - Customizing the avatar
 - Custom "Home" screen -- out of "Latest", "Watch", "News", and "Popular" categories, I could choose which ones to exclude, anfd in which order they appear
 
 ### TikTok
 - Jumping to "Recently Viewed" video when creator's account is clicked
 - Double click to "like"
 
 ### Telegram
 - Almost momentarily sysncs with all logged in devices
 - Can host thousand of people in chat groups
 - Great sticker options
 - Comfortable location sharing -- share live location for 15mins, 1hr, or 8hrs
 
 ### Slack
 - Awesome device syncing -- I attached the picture to a message on the phone and that same file appeared on my laptop before the message was sent
 - The concent of channels and direct messages are kept visually separate (as oppose to telegram)

## Notes

Creating a GIF was tough because I never did anything like that. I captured the screen, but didn't know how to convert it to GIF format.
